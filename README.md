# Notes for the images

My 'Figure' function was not working on my computer.

I followed the exact format in the module 6.5,
I already checked to see if I had gmaps or nbextension enabled in command line, and Anaconda already gave me an result these were all setup. 
I also tried importing matplotlib, and tried utilizing the commands from there but I was not getting the image file so I wasn't able to load any image files.


# Vacation Search

Based on the traveler's weather preferences by using the vacation search button and locating a place with selected min/max temperature. For this challenge, I set 60 as min and 90 as max temperature.

# Vacation Itinerary

By using the table that was created in Vacation_Itinerary python file (min/max 60~90 cities), one should (in correct coding display) see marks with routes to each city with different destination.
